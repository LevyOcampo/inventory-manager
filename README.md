# Inventory Management System  

This project is a **full-stack inventory management system** built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend). It uses **MySQL** for database management and **Sequelize** as an ORM.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

### **Frontend (`inventory-manager`)**  
- **React** (v18.3) - UI Framework  
- **Vite** - Development & Build Tool  
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing  
- **React Icons** - Icons for UI components  
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests  
- **Bootstrap** - Styling  

### **Backend (`inventory-backend`)**  
- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime)  
- **Express.js** - Web framework for Node.js  
- **MySQL2** - MySQL database client  
- **Sequelize** - ORM for database management  
- **dotenv** - Environment variable management  
- **CORS** - Middleware for handling cross-origin requests

# 🚀 Getting Started

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LevyOcampo/inventory-manager.git
cd inventory-manager
```


# 🖥️ Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd inventory-frontend
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:5173

# 🛠️ Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd ../inventory-backend
```
Create a .env file with your database credentials:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=inventory_db
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Start the server:
```bash
node index.js
```
The backend should now be running at http://localhost:3000

# 🗃️ Database Setup
Create the MySQL database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
```
The tables are automatically created by Sequelize when the backend starts. Make sure your database credentials in .env are correct.

# 🌐 Connecting Frontend to Backend
Ensure that your frontend API calls (e.g., fetch, axios) are pointed to:

```arduino
http://localhost:3000
```
You may also set up a proxy in vite.config.js for development convenience.

# ✅ Done!
You should now be able to use the Inventory Manager app locally.
